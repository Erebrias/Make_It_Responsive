      <h1>About us</h1>
      <em>Inova</em>
      <p>We are a newly formed company focused around frugal innovation.<br>
         We have a goal to delevier more value at a lower cost so that more people have access to a product.
         To achieve such a goal we have adopted a mindset of simplicity and extreme low cost without sacrificing the quality of the user experience.<br>
         In our work with frugal innovation we have come up with he idea of spreading what we have learned to a wider audience<br>
         </p>
         <p><strong>What we do</strong></p>
         <p>
           <table>
             <ul>
               <li>Keep it simple</li>
               <li>Build circualar value networks</li>
               <li>Croudsource Solutions</li>
               <li>Simplify structures and empower employees</li>
             </ul>
             </table>
         </p>
         <p>
           We search for individuals or groups that can form adversity into opporunity, someone with the ablity to turn something of low value to something of high value.<br>
           The art of doing more with less is what is essentially called frugal innovation. We can find examples of frugal innovation all around the world. For example;<br>
           the area around Lima, Peru is extremely dry and only gets around one inch of rainfall each year. So engineers found a way to create water out of air. By drawing inn humid 
           air they produce 90 liters of water every day.
         </p>
         <p>
         We hope to give people ideas of how to better the future for humanity through frugal innovation and our innovation camp will help people come up with ideas they may 
         not have thought about otherwise
